# Nexys2
## The project was created in the Xilinx ISE 14.1 program on the Nexus 2 Spartan 3E board and written in VHDL

This project is based on the Nexus 2 debugging board with a Spartan 3E crystal and its essence is to receive a signal from an external generator to an external ADC module PmodAD1 ADCS7476. From the ADC, the signal through the Spi interface is sent to the fpga board, then the signal passes through the FIR filter, which is synthesized in MatLab, and is output via the SPI protocol to the PmodDA2 DAC121S101 DAC. It is also possible to select a sawtooth signal in the project, which is generated by the algorithm, and send it to the DAC. The sine is also configured in a tabular way, with a maximum count of 4095, since we use a 12-bit DAC, which we will output to the DAC for further observation on an oscilloscope.
The top_modul top-level file can be found along the path Nexy2_sin_filtr/top_modul.vhd and it contains the following components:
  * spi_master: A module for exchanging data over the SPI protocol with a DAC.
  * filter: A module for filtering data applied to signals from the ADC.
  * ADC_priem: A module for receiving data from the ADC via the SPI interface.

To start the project, you need to run the file Nexy2_sin_filtr/Nexy2_sin_filter.xise.
